Description: Easily and reproducibly assess exposure to elemental carbon attributable to traffic (ECAT)
    at specific locations in and around Cincinnati, Ohio. The package calculates predictions of ECAT 
    exposure from a land use regression model developed by Dr. Patrick Ryan based on ambient air sampling 
    in Cincinnati, OH between 2001 and 2005. Additionally scale estimates to account for temporal variation
    in ECAT in the region.
